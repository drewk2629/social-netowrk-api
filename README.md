# social-network-api
## User Story
As a Social Media startup, I want an API for my Social Network that uses a NoSQL database (mongoose)
so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
## How To Use
After cloning the repository, open a terminal in the root directory and run "npm i." 
This will install all the needed dependencies. 

After the install is complete, still in the root of the directory, run npm start. 
This will invoke node server.js to get the server running. 

From there we will access our data with an app called Insomnia. 
(Feel free to use whatever API application you feel comfortable with, in the walkthrough I will be using Insomnia to test routes and their functionality.)
